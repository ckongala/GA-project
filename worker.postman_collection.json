really quick at the top As you see we have a guest  as you know we have a guest from National Security Council John Kirby with us today whos going to take your questions ahead of the state visit As you know that will be happening on Thursday  our first state visit with France And  first state visit clearly with  in this administration So with that Im going to just start right away and turn it over to Kirby All right John  Mr Kirby Thank you so much Karine Well as Karine said Ive just got a couple of comments here at the top about the state visit As the first state visit of the BidenHarris administration this is an opportunity to highlight a foundational component of this administrations approach to foreign policy and thats through alliances France is a vital global partner and of course the United States oldest ally Our economic ties span established and cuttingedge sectors with major investments in both directions supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in each country Our defense and security cooperation continues to expand and of course is vital to peace and stability all around the world Our partnership in tackling tough global challenges is underpinned by our shared commitment to democratic principles values and institutions And our cultural ties remain a source of strength and importance to our bilateral relationship France remains as you know a top destination for many Americans and vice versa So just briefly on the schedule breakdown On Wednesday President Macron will join Vice President Harris in visiting NASA headquarters to showcase our deepening collaboration on space in support of Earth climate and space science and space exploration The bulk of the state visit events will take place on Thursday starting with the official arrival ceremony While then  while President Biden and President Macron conduct a bilateral discussion there will be a separate program for the First Lady and Mrs Macron In the afternoon the Vice President and Secretary Blinken will host a luncheon at the State Department in honor of President and Mrs Macron And then of course the visit culminates in the state dinner here at the White House that evening Throughout all of these events you can expe  you can expect to see on display both our long shared history as allies as well as our deep partnership in taking on the most urgent global challenges of today and tomorrow We anticipate that well have more to share about the details of the state dinner and the guest list later this week While there are specific areas where we anticipate well make progress during this visit I want to stress that this visit really largely serves as a celebration of the strong footing of this relationship  one that is well rooted in our history from the very beginnings of our country while also oriented squarely toward the future And its a very dynamic exciting future that were looking forward to With that Ill take some questions  Ms JeanPierre Andrea do you want to go first  The Press Yeah So John I wonder if you could just say a few words about why France was chosen for the first state visit I know you sort of talked about the historic ties but is this also kind of you know a gesture in terms of making  making the relationship a little smoother after the AUKUS dust of last year  Mr Kirby I kind of alluded to it in the answer Andrea A real  kind of a long pole in the tent for President Bidens approach to foreign policy and to the world around us is the  is the strength and power of alliances And our alliance is something that no other nation in the world can match  the network of American alliances France is our oldest one And I mean if you look at whats going on in Ukraine look at whats going on in the IndoPacific and the tensions with China France is really at the center of all those things And President Macron has been a dynamic leader inside the G7 particularly there in Europe And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits  The Press Can I just follow up on that One big issue that is dividing the US and Europe at this moment is  are the EV credits in the Inflation Reduction Act  Mr Kirby Yeah  The Press This is an issue  I mean I realize the way the EU is structured  you know the EU Brussels inaudible trade policy Do you expect that issue to come up Do you think theres any chance of resolving that short of a WTO you know dispute  Mr Kirby I think certainly that the issue will most likely come up I think we look forward to having that discussion with our French counterparts As you know last month the United States stood up  helped stood up  stand up an EUUS IRA taskforce just last month to try to make sure that we can better understand the concerns of our European friends about this and so many other issues The bottom line for us is first of all we want to understand the concerns Were absolutely willing to have that conversation and to find a way to work through those issues of concern But its not a zerosum game I mean clean energy  thats a tide that raises all boats the more we can transition to a clean energy economy around the world And theres plenty of opportunity for everybody in that So were looking forward to having those discussions  The Press Thanks Karine and John On a different topic I was hoping  what is the White Houses message the Presidents message to people in China who are peaceably protesting COVID lockdowns there And then did the topic of Chinas zeroCOVID policy come up in the Presidents bilateral meeting with President Xi when they met in Indonesia a couple weeks ago  Mr Kirby They did talk about COVID and the effect that the pandemic had had around the world Clearly that came up inside the conversation I dont know if specifically the zeroCOVID policy was an issue of discussion but certainly COVID was on the agenda as you might expect that it would be And our message to peaceful protesters around the world is the same and consistent People should be allowed the right to assemble and to peacefully protest policies or laws or dictates that they take issue with  The Press Does the White House support their efforts to sort of regain personal freedoms in light of these lockdowns  Mr Kirby The White House supports the right of peaceful protest  The Press And then on a different topic the State Department announced today that Russia abruptly canceled the latest rounds of arms negotiations  Mr Kirby Yeah  The Press Is the present plan to reach out to anybody about that Is there any White House reaction to that  Mr Kirby I dont have any phone calls or conversations to read out What youre talking about is the Bilateral Consultative Commission And this is a component of the New START Treaty that was signed on to in 2010 This is a  its basically an opportunity for both sides to get together and talk about the technicalities the formalities the compliance mechanisms that are in place with respect to New START This would have been the first one that we would have put in place since COVID which obviously prevented those kinds of facetoface meetings so we very much were looking forward to starting It was supposed to start tomorrow And we were very much looking forward to that because we continue to believe in the importance of New START We havent got  havent received excuse me a real solid answer from the Russians as to why they postponed this Were going to be working through the embassy to try to figure out what happened here And wed like to see it get back on the schedule as soon as possible because its important Its not just important for our two nations Its important for the rest of the world  Ms JeanPierre Okay were going to go the back The gentleman in the back Go ahead  The Press Thank you Karine Two questions John First the niece of the Ayatollah Khamenei was arrested in Tehran recently as part of the protest mark Does the administration having stated its support for peaceful protests have any particular statement about her arrest  Mr Kirby We would I think say  stay very consistent sir that we believe in the right of peaceful protest We have made it clear that we stand with particularly  its largely Iranian women but its obviously beyond that  but particularly their concerns about the dictates that have affected their lives personally And we will continue to do whatever we can to not only support their right of protest but to hold the regime accountable for the way its treating its people  The Press And along the same lines is the administration going to put out a statement to the military junta in Burma about the published reports of the incarceration and keeping incommunicado the former leader Aung San Suu Kyi  Mr Kirby I dont have a preview of some sort of statement to read out to you today Weve been very clear about our concerns over  over the militarys domination there and their practice and their policies particularly the way they treat political prisoners But I dont have a statement for you today about that particular issue  The Press On China John is it the USs assessment that these protests weve seen are widespread Or are they perhaps more isolated incidents that are being amplified by social media  Mr Kirby I dont think that we know a whole lot more about the geographic location size scale and scope of them than what youre learning as well through social media and through traditional media Its not like we have I think a finer sense of insight than whats already out there in the public sphere So I  you know I dont  I dont have a sense of that  The Press In that realm the statement you issued  or that was issued earlier today didnt include any explicit calls for China to stop detaining and harming protesters and journalists Why not  Mr Kirby Were watching this closely as you might expect we would And again we continue to stand up and support the right of peaceful protest And I think were going to watch this closely and well see where things go  The Press Can I ask you a quick one on Iran  Mr Kirby Sure  The Press The US Mens National Soccer Team   Mr Kirby Yeah  had thrown up an image of the old flag before them including the Islamic Republic symbol  Mr Kirby Thats right  The Press Was the  does the White House have any comment on that decision  Mr Kirby No actually we dont And this isnt the kind of thing that you would  that the White House would comment on USA Soccer is a private entity and they  they make their own decisions about those kinds of things And we wouldnt  we wouldnt comment on that We wish them all the best tomorrow  The Press The team had said it was cons  it changed the flag after consultations with various entities afterward Are you aware of anyone in the US government speaking to the team about   Mr Kirby I am not aware of any conversations by anybody in the US government that had anything to do with their decision either to post that image previously and then to take it down and replace it no  Ms JeanPierre JJ  The Press On China again John is it the USs  is it the USs assessment that theres any sort of risk to the US economy or the US supply chain because of the protests  Mr Kirby We dont see any particular impact right now to the supply chain as a result of these protests  The Press And then on the vaccines Has the US offered any USmade vaccines  coronavirus vaccines  to China  the mRNA vaccines  Mr Kirby We have not offered any to China at this time As you know we are the largest supplier of COVID vaccines around the world And we have not received any requests or any interest by China to receive our vaccines  Ms JeanPierre Sebastian  The Press Thank you very much Thank you John Again on China You had just noted that youre watching this closely as we might expect Could you give us a sense of how much the President is engaging with this issue Is he watching it personally you know getting updated more than on maybe some other things  Mr Kirby The President is staying briefed on whats going on inside China Yes  The Press Is it fair to say hes closely briefed on this  Mr Kirby Any time  laughter   The Press Just  just trying to get an impression of like where hes at with this issue  Mr Kirby Ive never been in the room where he wasnt like closely briefed I mean yeah hes  hes  hes staying atop on whats  whats going on Hes monitoring this We all are So yes the President is certainly staying mindful of the protest activity  The Press Okay Thank you  Ms JeanPierre Alex way in the back  The Press Thanks Karine Thank you John You know I sort of assume that the United States supports peaceful protest around the world That with all due respect doesnt strike I would think most people as a novel position The question is   Mr Kirby Well Im glad that its not a novel position Its exactly where we should be  The Press But the President has explicitly drawn a contrast between autocracy and democracy here and also abroad Isnt this a moment  obviously without getting into some sort of grand conflict  to sort of assert the rights of people advocating for freedom and democracy more forcefully than perhaps we have  Mr Kirby This is I think a moment to reassert what we believe in when it comes to free assembly and  and peaceful protest And weve done that and will continue to do that whether its people protesting in Iran or China or anywhere else around the world Nothing has changed about the Presidents firm belief in the power of democracy and democratic institutions and how important that is But this is really a moment  to put it back into your words  this is a moment for  you know for the  for the Chinese people and the Chinese government to speak to We have been nothing but clear and consistent and I think youll see that going forward  Ms JeanPierre Peter and then Mary  The Press So just to follow up John On the China issue why is the White Houses line that everybody has the right to peacefully protest and not the US thinks its bad to lock people up in their houses to stop COVID  Mr Kirby Weve  weve made it clear Peter that a lockdown is not a policy that were going to support here Weve  weve come a long way over these last three years  hard to believe three years  in terms of treating COVID and preventing COVID So weve said you know a lockdown is not a policy that we support here But obviously there are people in China that  that have  have concerns about that And theyre protesting that and we believe they should be able to do that peacefully  The Press Okay And on the sanctions relief for Venezuela   Mr Kirby Yeah  The Press  why is it that President Biden would rather let US companies drill for oil in Venezuela than here in the US  Mr Kirby Thats not an accurate take on the Presidents view  The Press Earlier this month he said No more drilling There is no more drilling  Mr Kirby The President has issued 9000 permits for drilling on US federal lands Peter 9000 of them are being unused There are plenty of opportunities for oil and gas companies to drill here in the United States Now Ill let Chevron speak for this particular issue of sanctions relief but our expectation is it wont be a lot of oil coming out of there It will have to be shipped to the United States  The Press Does the President think theres some benefit to the climate to drill oil in Venezuela and not here  Mr Kirby No it has nothing to do with a benefit to the climate Peter Again there are 9000 unused permits here in the United States on federal land that oil and gas companies can and should take advantage of Nine thousand And were talking about one there in Venezuela Now look it remains to be seen how much will get drilled down there Itll be up to Chevron to decide that Peter But  but as a function of the sanction itself that oil whatever product is drilled has to come to the United States  Ms JeanPierre Go ahead Mary  The Press One more on China How concerned is the President that Chinas zeroCOVID strategy and that these restrictions may be inhibiting the economic recovery globally and here at home  Mr Kirby The President believes  and hes said this many times  I mean COVID absolutely has had an impact on the global economy Certainly its had an impact on supply chains and resources around the world And thats why the President wants to move the United States as quickly and as efficiently as we can through COVID so that  so that even our economy can get more on track than it already is becoming now So I mean it is having a global effect But what is also having a very acute significant global impact on the economy is the war in Ukraine And thats why were trying to go after a price cap on Russian oil Thats why were trying to give Ukraine the tools and capabilities they need to succeed on the battlefield so this  this war can end can end in a way in which Ukraine can be whole and sovereign and free So theres a  theres a lot of impacts on the global economy its not just about COVID  The Press But beyond just COVID generally I mean does he think that Chinas zeroCOVID strategy  that these restrictions are inhibiting the economic recovery  Mr Kirby The President recognizes that in many countries around the world COVID is still an issue And certainly to the degree that it inhibits a countrys ability to conduct commerce its having an impact on the world And China is a huge economic competitor out there But I wouldnt get into parsing the dollarfigure effect here of the remaining challenge of COVID in China But clearly China as a major economic player and China still struggling with COVID theres  obviously theres an impact on the economy  The Press And just one more On Paul Whelan his brother said he missed a scheduled phone call home to his family on Thursday which they say is incredibly unusual for him to miss a call especially on a holiday like that How concerned are you about this silence Have you received any information on his condition And just can you give us any update on any progress that may or may not have been made  Mr Kirby Im afraid I dont have an update for you This is the first Ive heard that there was a phone call that was missed So why dont you let me take that back and see if we can find out something for you I dont want to just speculate up here Obviously were deeply concerned about him and  and Brittney Griner and all Americans wrongfully detained overseas But let me take that question  Ms JeanPierre All done Mary Okay Go ahead Phil  The Press Thank you Two quick questions One on China and then on Ukraine Im wondering what is the Presidents reaction when he hears protesters in China chant freedom or Xi Jinping step down  Mr Kirby The President is not going to speak for protesters around the world theyre speaking for themselves  The Press And so theres no reaction  Mr Kirby These protesters are speaking for themselves What we are doing is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest  The Press And then my followup Is the backlog of arms shipments to Taiwan a result of our steppedup efforts to send arms to Ukraine  Mr Kirby What I can tell you is that we are constantly balancing as we must our own inventories the inventories of our allies and partners and people that we do conduct arm sales with as well as of course the inventory that the Ukrainian armed forces need to fight the Russian aggression And its a balancing act And with every single decision by the President to draw down DOD stocks you know he gets an assessment from the Pentagon about whether thats going to affect our readiness And were in constant touch with again allies and partners about their readiness needs because many of them are reliant on US systems And of course you know that includes Taiwan We just  the President just signed out  what a month or so ago  another billion dollars of Taiwan arm sales And of course were going to continue to look at what the next iteration of that needs to look like and when that would occur But we take very seriously our responsibility to help provide Taiwan the selfdefense capabilities that  that it needs Thats in accordance with law and policy and thats not going to change  The Press But in terms of those shipments actually going out the door to Taiwan currently is there a backlog when it comes to those arms being shipped  Mr Kirby Im not going to get into it at a public podium talking about inventory stocks of any system anywhere That just is not a good idea for  for us to do Certainly not from the podium We  we watch it very closely We make sure that our readiness can be preserved as well as the readiness of our allies and partners But look has  has all the provisions to Ukraine  has that  has that caused an effort inside the administration to make sure that we are  that we are judiciously monitoring stocks and inventories and working with the defense industry to plus them up and to make sure that those supply chains are still flowing Absolutely They  of course  of course we are But its a balance we strike every day  The Press Thank you sir  Mr Kirby Yeah  Ms JeanPierre All right way in the back there  The Press Thanks John regarding Turkey many are skeptical regarding the Turkish claims that the PKK was behind the explosion in Istanbul And now they are using this as a justification for a ground operation in Syria  Mr Kirby Yeah  The Press Did the US ask for evidence or did you offer help for the investigation Do you see this as a proper justification for a ground operation in Syria  Mr Kirby I dont believe weve  were  offered anything to help with the investigation And were not in a position to  to say specifically who was responsible We condemned the violence at the time We condemn it today And as Ive said as recently as a week or so ago we do need to remember that Turkey continues to be  to fall victim to terrorist attacks whether its near that border or elsewhere inside the country And they have a right to  to defend themselves and their citizens against attacks Now what weve said additionally is that we want to see the tensions deescalate here And we dont want to see any actions that A lead to the potential of additional casualties particularly civilian casualties And B do anything that would harm our efforts to continue to work with our Syrian counterparts against ISIS which remains a viable credible threat inside Iraq and Syria and we got to keep the pressure on them  The Press But is this a greenlight for ErdoÄan to go inside Syria when you say they  they have the right to defend themselves  Mr Kirby They do have the right to defend themselves They had  they have  they have suffered terrorist attacks But we dont want to see actions particularly inside Syria that are going to lead to a potential for more casualties more loss of innocent life and any diminution of our efforts  distraction away from our efforts because we have troops in Syria that  to go after  to ISIS The other thing I would  Id mentioned is we also dont want to see any actions inside Syria by Turkey or anyone else that could put American lives at risk because there are Americans on the ground and theyre helping the SDF  The Press Thanks John There were some concrete steps moving the relationship forward in terms of a bilateral basis after the meeting between President Biden and Xi  Mr Kirby Right  The Press Is there any concern or will that  those steps have any effect on how the US responds to any Chinese response to the protests that are currently ongoing  Mr Kirby I think were going to have to watch this going forward Phil What I can tell you is As you and I are talking today theres  theres been no change to our desire to continue to see these channels of communication stay open And we were heartened coming away from the G20 that both leaders were able to agree on getting some of these workinglevel discussions back open And so were still in that mode Phil where we want to continue to get those  get those discussions back up in play And as for whether or not therell be an impact from the protests were just going to have to  I think were just  as I said were going to watch this and see where it goes  The Press One more quick one Apologies Karine Were kind of in crunch time for the price cap you mentioned a few minutes ago  Mr Kirby Yeah  The Press Is there a sense inside the White House right now that the President or the team will need to have more of a public posture in terms of trying to get this across the finish line I know its kind of an EUlevel issue right now but   Mr Kirby Yeah I dont think  Phil I dont think were at that point right now where we feel theres some sort of inordinate pressure to  to be more public about it than we already have been I think weve been very public about it Or that you know  you know we need to smash down on the accelerator here The discussions are going well we think And we strongly believe that a price cap is a good approach the right approach to limit Mr Putins ability to profiteer off this war And our EU colleagues are working through the modalities of it right now how that would be implemented what level its going to be at We think those discussions are going on in a pretty robust fashion so I dont think we believe theres a pressure on us right now to get more involved than we already are  The Press Thanks John  Ms JeanPierre Go ahead Steve  The Press Thanks John I want to try to get your response to a letter that was sent by the leadership of five news organizations to the administration One of those news organizations is the New York Times These organizations worked with Julian Assange prior to the publication of classified cables by WikiLeaks and theyre asking that the administration drop the Espionage Act charge that was put forward against Assange by the Trump administration Generally whats the White Houses response to that request And Ill start there and then Ill ask you a followup  Mr Kirby Yeah were aware of it and we would refer you to the Justice Department  The Press All right I anticipated that answer What is your assessment or what is the National Security Councils assessment of the harm that was done by the WikiLeaks leak in 2012 That would inform any decision by the Justice Department  Mr Kirby I think you know we  if you go back and look at how the administration responded in 2012  and of course President Biden was then Vice President at the time  we would  we would maintain that we  that what  what we said at the time  what was said at the time that those  that those leaks those revelations in the public sphere were damaging to US national security  Ms JeanPierre Inaudible  The Press Yeah I just wanted to ask The head of NATO is warning that essentially Vladimir Putin is using winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine What specifically is the United States doing in conjunction with its partners and allies to counter that given the continued attacks on the energy grid  Mr Kirby So youre referring to the  his targeting of civilian infrastructure Yeah So I mean this is a guy whos used food as a weapon Hes used fear as a weapon He  and as  as our  as the SecretaryGeneral of NATO said now hes using the coming cold weather here to basically try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees When you take a look at what hes hitting its almost all civilian infrastructure And its largely  as you pointed out  its energy its water its the kind of resources that people need as they get ready to brace for what will no doubt be a cold winter And so what were doing is a couple of things First of all were still going to continue to provide the Ukrainian armed forces with the tools weapons the capabilities the training that they need so that they can be successful on the battlefield And they have been very successful in just the last few weeks Secondly were working with allies and partners around the world  and certainly working inside the various agencies of this administration  to get spare parts equipment transformers the kinds of material theyll need to get some of these systems and networks back up and running and get the power turned back on in much of Ukraine  as well as of course water resources So were working on that very very hard  again with allies and partners Its  some of the material will no doubt come from the United States But we also recognize that their grid is based on infrastructure that is uniquely European And so were going to  were working with again allies and partners in the region as well to see what they can do to get  to get more in there to keep the lights on and the water running But its despicable Its absolutely despicable what he is doing in these last few weeks Not that he hasnt been despicable before but you  you hit exactly on the issue that these targets are largely civilian And its designed to want  for one reason and thats to try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees because he cant bring the Ukrainian armed forces to its knees And you would think that now  going into I guess its eight months now which is hard to believe  actually going into our ninth month here  that he would have learned  he Putin would have learned a while ago that you just cant bring the Ukrainian people to their knees  Ms JeanPierre Two more Go ahead  The Press Kim Jong Un says he is trying to build the most powerful nuclear force Do you expect the North Koreans to conduct a nuclear test in the near future  Mr Kirby Weve said that we believe Kim could conduct a nuclear test at any time  The Press Okay One more His daughter made a public appearance twice this month What do you think about her appearance Why suddenly now  Mr Kirby I certainly cant speak to the parenting skills of Kim Jong Un Im afraid I dont have anything for you there Laughter Look in all seriousness the man continues to advance military capabilities that continue to destabilize the region  not just the Peninsula but the region And were taking this seriously which is why were improving our intelligence capabilities there collection capabilities in the region Its why were working so hard with Japan and South Korea bilaterally and trilaterally The President had a chance to meet with both leaders while we were at the G20 to advance our own defense capabilities and our own defense needs People sometimes forget and Ive said it a lot you guys probably roll your eyes when I say this because Ive said it before but five of our seven treaty alliances because since we  since we started the briefing talking about alliances  five of seven are in the IndoPacific and we take them seriously because they put on us very significant security commitments to help with the defense of Japan and South Korea respectively in this case And we take that seriously which means we got to make sure were ready for the kinds of capabilities that he clearly is so interested in continuing to pursue  Ms JeanPierre Go ahead Gerren And then Monica youll have the last question  The Press Thanks Karine Thanks John There have been reports about the penal colony that Brittney Griner is being held indicating that she potentially is exposed to forced labor and homophobia and racism Is there any update about her physical and mental health And I know CIA Director Burns did meet with his counterpart in Russia Are there any plans to have another meeting between officials between US and Russia to specifically discuss this ongoing negotiation to get her home  Mr Kirby Great questions both of them On the  on the second one we continue to have ongoing conversations with Russian officials about Brittneys release as well as Mr Whelans in trying to get them home to their families where they belong I can assure you that those conversations are ongoing and we want them both home as fast as possible and this administration is going to stay committed to that task On her condition I think you can understand for  for privacy reasons Im not going to get into much detail about her physical health I wouldnt do that I can just tell you that were taking that very seriously as well knowing where she is and what penal colonies are designed to do And were making  were trying to make sure we have as much access and information about her condition as possible Sometimes thats done more through her representatives than it is from our diplomatic presence just because of the modalities of it But were doing the best we can to stay on top of it as much as we can  Ms JeanPierre Monica last question  The Press John can you share any update on whether President Biden will accept the invitation of Mexican President LÃ³pez Obrador to attend the Three Amigos summit in Mexico City I know that had been talked about as potentially scheduled for December It now may be pushed back to January Is there anything you can share on that  Mr Kirby The North American Leaders Summit Yeah The President is looking forward to being able to have  to have that meeting But we dont have a date yet or anything to say on the schedule Nothing to confirm on the schedule right now But hes looking forward to the discussion absolutely All right  The Press Thanks John  Mr Kirby Thanks guys Happy late Thanksgiving to you  Ms JeanPierre Thanks John Okay before we dive into questions just I have a couple things  a few updates at the top to share with all of you As you know President Biden committed to doing everything within his power to address Putins price hike at the pump Today gas prices have returned to the levels they were prior to Putins invasion of Ukraine As the chart behind me shows the national average is 355 per gallon down over 145 per gallon from the June peak The most common price is 299 per gallon Thats saving American families with two cars about 160 per month on average This is important breathing room for American families and meets a key commitment that the President made to them So its no accident either  on a couple of things President Biden has been releasing oil from the reserve as you know which was a historic action that this President took He called on international partners to release oil as well And hes been calling on oil and gas companies to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump The Presidents actions have helped bring prices down for families and he will continue to do everything possible to bring prices down even further Earlier today the President signed a Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for ConflictRelated Sexual Violence to strengthen the US governments effort to combat rape as a weapon of war This Presidential Memorandum directs the State Department Treasury Department and other federal agency to leverage sanctions authorities assistance restrictions and other tools to promote accountability for perpetrators of conflictrelated sexual violence With this executive action US departments and agency are for the first time ever being directed to ensure equal consideration of acts of conflictrelated sexual violence when identifying targets and preparing designations for potential sanctions Under President Bidens leadership the United States will continue leading efforts to rally other nations and international organizations to prevent and promote accountability for acts of conflictrelated sexual violence Todays action is part of the Presidents broader commitment to work to address all forms of genderbased violence Now finally today President Biden met with three US winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize Dr Carolyn Bertozzi who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry Dr John Clauser who won the Nobel Prize in Physics and Dr Douglas Diamond who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences The President is restarting an important tradition that just like  just like he does for winning sports teams as you have seen him do in the past 20 months or so the President meets with US winners of the Nobel Prize Their achievements show how taking on the biggest questions can establish new fields of inquiry promote technology innovation and expand the boundaries of what is possible Their work is a reminder of why the President often says that the  America can be defined by one word and you all know that word that he uses is possibilities With that Im going to go out of school for a second And I know theres a young reporter in the room who would like to ask a question Eva Eva Shapiro  The Press Shapiro  Ms JeanPierre Sha  oh pardon me And where are you from What   The Press Austin Texas  Ms JeanPierre Austin Texas And you are part of the Kids Scoop   The Press KidScoop Media  Ms JeanPierre All right Well welcome to the briefing room Its great to have you And you could  youre going to trump AP And  laughs  Ill take your first question  The Press Given the situation in Iran with protesting what are we going to do or what can we do to help  Ms JeanPierre So thats an excellent question and an important question to ask And we have answered this question multiple times here at the at this podium and the President spoke to this when he was in the  in the halls of the United Nations not too long ago in September And he said We stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights End quote Theres a lot that we can do and a lot that we are doing to support those brave citizens again of Iran  those brave protesters Were taking steps both on our own as the United States and also in partnership with other countries just around the world and including organizations like the United Nations as I mentioned when the President first made his comments about what we were seeing in Iran from the civilians But let me just give you a couple of examples Were using economic tools like sanctions against Iranian officials We supported the UN Human Rights Councils vote to create a factfinding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran which  which was really historic something that we had not seen So were working with civil society organizations to make sure Iran is removed from a United Nations body focused on women called the UN Commission on the Status of Women We have expressed support for the Joint Statement by Women Foreign Ministers on Iran And were speaking out over and over again and raising awareness and making sure that those brave women and citizens are lifted up as they are really fighting for their basic rights But thank you so much for your question I really appreciate you And again welcome  welcome to the briefing room Hopefully you come back All right Go ahead  The Press Thanks Karine And welcome to the briefing room On  two and a half weeks ago when the President held his press conference after the midterm results he said hed be inviting congressional leadership of both parties over to the White House after his trip to the G20 Were a weekplus since hes been back Has that invite gone out And when is that meeting going to take place  Ms JeanPierre So as you know Congress has just returned so the President is looking forward to talking to speaking with  to Democratic and Republican leadership I dont have anything to preview for you at this time on a date on when that will happen But he is  this is something that he is indeed looking forward to and we will make that happen as soon as we can  The Press Today is this deadline for counties to certify election results in a number of states including Arizona where at least one county has refused to certify the results of the midterm elections from a couple weeks ago citing the conduct of the election in another county in Maricopa County Does the White House  is the White House monitoring sort of statelevel and local and countylevel efforts to sort of overturn election results or not certify election results And does the President have any response  Ms JeanPierre So the  very good question I dont have anything to share on if were monitoring anything specific or in particular Im sure thats something the DNC is doing and other committees are clearly focusing on on those particulars very closely Look   The Press Inaudible  Ms JeanPierre Yeah No but I  weve been very clear on the sacred right to vote and how  you know and how its important that the American people feel like their vote will be counted And that  and he has denounced the election deniers that we have heard from on the other side and he has called that out and he has every confidence in our electoral system  The Press And then just lastly we know those rail negotiations are  seem to be nearing impasse Theres a report in the Washington Post that the President plans to ask Congress to step in and either extend the coolingoff period for talks or take some other measures to try to prevent a potentially devastating shutdown of the rail system in the next couple of weeks Does  can you confirm that the President does plan to ask Congress to step in and take action here  Ms JeanPierre Look I dont have anything right now at this time to announce or preview on any announcement that the President is going to make Once he is ready to make that announcement certainly he  we will let you know  or make an announcement of any kind related to this we will clearly share that with all of you I do want to say a couple of things which is really important as we look at whats currently happening Look from the beginning the President has been very clear A shutdown is unacceptable because of the impact that it would have on jobs and families and farms and businesses and communities just across the country The President is directly involved in the process and has been engaged with his team and also has had conversation with members of Congress on this particular issue in case  in case resolving the issue  in case resolving the issue falls to them as it has 18 times in the last 60 years as you know I know you guys are following this closely And in addition  in addition to the Presidents involvement Secretary Walsh has been in contact with rail workers the unions there He has been in direct connection  contact with them Secretary Buttigieg has been in contact with rail companies And Secretary Vilsack has engaged agriculture and industry stakeholders as well So this has been very much not just the President but clearly the three Secretaries that I just mentioned in his administration A majority of unions as you all know have voted to ratify the  the temporary agreement Thats 8 out of 12 There are 12 unions involved And the best option that we believe that the President believes is still for the parties to resolve these themselves res  resolve this themselves and to do this really in short order  The Press Members of the Democratic National Committee are meeting here in Washington later this week to talk about the potential calendar for the partys presidential nomination process in 2024 Theyre doing this in essence at the behest of the President who has signaled that hes not a huge fan of Iowa going first given the lack of diversity in that state Can you say whether he intends to weigh in on this issue as or before they meet or if he indeed believes that Iowa should lose its firstinthenation status  Ms JeanPierre So look this is not something that Im going to speak to from here This is something that the Democratic National Committee as you know is  that committee that youre speaking of is out of the DNC And so I would refer you to them specifically I dont have anything else to preview or to share about any comments or statements that the President may make on this particular issue But again from here Im not going to comment from  on this I would refer you to the  to the DNC  The Press Are there any plans for the President to go to Georgia in the final days of the Senate runoff  Ms JeanPierre So Ive been asked this question before about what the President is  could potentially be doing for the Georgia runoff I have to be careful because it is an existing  existing race that is happening And so I cannot  I am covered by the Hatch Act so I cant speak specifically to this But what I can say and Ive said this before The President is willing to do whatever is needed of him by Senator Warnock I dont have anything else to preview from here  The Press So does that mean that the ask hasnt been made from Senator Warnock inaudible  Ms JeanPierre I really  I just  I dont want to dive into request or asks Thats something that we didnt do during the midterms the past several months Were certainly not going to start now What I can say I dont have anything to preview for you at this time or to announce But again the President is willing to do whatever is asked of him  The Press The Boston Globe is reporting that the President is going to be in Boston on Friday for a fundraiser Can you confirm that trip And then also they note that that day the Royals will be in Boston as well for the Earthshot Prize Is there potentially going to be an overlap or meeting Or will the President   Ms JeanPierre So I heard about that This is the  the Prince of Wales is going to be  so  laughter  I dont have anything to share on the Presidents travels for  any traveling announcement to make for Friday or any  any future date after tomorrow As you all know hell be going to Michigan Once we have something to share certainly we will share that And as far as the  the Royals being in town I dont have anything to preview as well  The Press Finally the President said he did a part of his annual physical while he was talking about  answering a question about this specifically in Nantucket And he said he would do the rest before the end of the year What did he mean by that And then will be  he be going to Walter Reed as he did last year in the next couple of weeks  Ms JeanPierre So thats a good question I havent  I actually have not talked to him about that I remember him saying that over the weekend Look I was asked this question just at the last briefing You know the President is in good health and maintains an active lifestyle You see him on a  almost on a regular basis yourselves And you can see  he always says Watch me He will have a physical in the upcoming months And the results will be certainly released as  the same way as it was last year in a very transparent way And we will be sharing with  that with all of you as soon as  as soon as we have it Go ahead Steven  The Press Thanks Just to go back to the rail labor dispute What would drive the President to seek a congressional resolution here  Ms JeanPierre Look Im not going to legislate from here What I can say is we have been in regular communication with Congress for the past several months But certainly not going to legislate or  or lay out the process from here  The Press Let me ask you this In 1992 the last time Congress intervened to prevent a labor rail shutdown Joe Biden was one of six senators and only six to say that the Congress should not intervene that its a dynamic that favors the railroads against the interests of the workers Why would he seek congressional intervention now  Ms JeanPierre Look again I cant  Im  when the President has made a decision on this if he makes a decision on this youll hear directly from him Dont have anything to share or preview at this time As I mentioned moments ago the President has been in regular contact with members of Congress He has been directly involved in having those conversations directly involved with his administration I laid out what Secretary Walsh is doing what Secretary Buttigieg and Secretary Vilsack  This is something that has been a priority for this President and this administration for the past several months Majority  as I just laid out also moments ago  of unions have ratified the tentative agreement Again Im not going to legislate from here not going to get into  get ahead of any potential announcement But as you stated in cases like this issues falls to Congress And it has done this 18 times in the last 60 years So again its not unusual but Im just not going to get into a hypothetical from here at this time Go ahead  The Press A couple questions about the lame duck agenda The President said last week that he was going to try to ban assault weapons during the session What does that look like Is he making calls Is he taking meetings on this Has he tasked the team with working on this And does he think that 60 votes are actually possible here thats within reach somehow  Ms JeanPierre So Im so glad you asked the question Mary because this morning when I was in the Oval Office in a meeting with the President he actually brought this up himself because he knows how his comments were reported over the weekend And he wanted to be very clear and he said that you know he believes that its important to keep this issue  in banning assault weapons  at the front of minds of Americans He believes that it is  it is  it is also up to him as President of the United States to make the case for why it is critical to move forward with assault  assault weapons ban And so he  he  look he understands whats at stake He wants the American people to continue to understand whats at stake We know many communities have felt this very deeply very personally And he also believes  you know there were families this past  this past Thanksgiving holiday who looked around their table and they were missing members of their family because of this gun violence this horrific gun violence that we have seen as recently as this weekend as recently as just last week And he believes that they deserve  they deserve to  for us for him to continue to talk about this continue to put this out there about the importance of getting this done for American communities But again look we understand its an uphill battle We understand that this is not easy He gets that But it doesnt mean that hes going to stop fighting for it or that hes going to stop talking about it  The Press And on one other issue raising the debt ceiling Weve seen Republicans who have threatened to use this as leverage to get some of their agenda items through How much importance does the President placed on raising the debt ceiling during a lame duck session  Ms JeanPierre So look you know weve been clear about this When it comes to the debt ceiling it should not  it should not be used  or never be a matter of political brinksmanship Weve been very clear about that And congr  you know congressional Republicans they passed this with the last President three times  the former President They  they passed to lift the debt ceiling three times Theres no reason why this should not be happening this time around The Congress you know needs to take the responsibility once again to address the debt ceiling before it expires And they need to act sooner rather than later Look now that Congress is back we believe that you know there will be more of an urgency to get this done And look this is  this is about you know the sooner they act  you know this is about our economy This will be better for our economy So were  have those conversation The President as I was asked moments ago is going to meet with leadership from both the Hou  from both the House and the Senate the Democratic and Republican leadership And certainly well be having these conversations  The Press You just laid out for us the gas price  that prices are back down to levels before the war Housing prices on the other hand are not coming down nearly fast enough Given the split Congress  you know weve talked about some of the difficulty of the lameduck session  I mean have you run out of options in terms of pressing down housing prices And what can you do to help people there especially if the student debt issue doesnt you know go your way  Ms JeanPierre Look we are  as the President said to your  to your last statement about the student debt relief his relief plan  hes optimistic Hes an optimistic person Hes going to continue to fight for a plan thats going to help close to 40 million Americans across the country And lets not forget 90 percent of them are making less than 75000 a year That matters That is a plan that is going to give people a little bit of breathing room So we are  we are confident in our  in our  in our legal standing if you will As you know its up  its up to the Supreme Court and were going to continue to fight That will not end But to your question Look affor  housing affordability is a central challenge for families we know that  as you just laid that out Andrea And thats due to longstanding shortfall of affordable housing plus increased demand for homes during the pandemic and a reduced number of homes due to previous supply chain challenges So the good news is this that we are starting to see the housing market cool by a range of measures just a bit Several data sources now show that rent falling are  or rent growth easing in recent months which should mean lower shelter inflation on months ahead And  but we understand and we get it As I just said its a central issue for many families and many Americans Theres more work to do And we will continue to  to use all of the administrative tools to make sure that we give  we continue to give families some relief  The Press Just a question about Twitter You know theres a researcher at Stanford who says that this is a critical moment really in terms of ensuring that Twitter does not become a vector for misinformation I mean are you concerned about the  you know Elon Musk says theres more and more subscribers coming online Are you concerned about that And what tools do you have Who is it at the White House that is really keeping track of this  Ms JeanPierre So look this is something that were certainly keeping an eye on And look we  you know we have always been very clear and  that when it comes to social media platforms it is their responsibility to make sure that when it comes to misinformation when we  when it comes to the hate that were seeing that they take action that they continue to take action Again were all keeping a close eye on this Were all monitoring whats  whats currently occurring And we see  you know we see it with our own eyes of what you all are reporting and just for ourselves whats happening on Twitter But again social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms from being used by any user to incite violence especially violence directed at individual communities as we have been seeing And the President has been very clear on calling that out Hell continue to do that And were going to continue to monitor the situation Go ahead Phil  The Press Thanks Karine I dont think the President has spoken to the House Republican leader since the day after the election even though the House was called for Republicans a few days later Does that have anything to do with the fact that he may not actually be Speaker of the House next Congress Or how are you guys kind of working through that  Ms JeanPierre Well no I  that  I mean Congress has been out Theyre just coming back in Look the President has been really clear and hes underscored this many times that hes here to find common ground and work across the aisle That is something that he has done while hes been President here  the CHIPS and Science Act as you  you all know The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is something that hes been  hes done as well And he has signed into law more than 200 pieces of legislation that were bipartisan So look hes looking forward to having those conversations with congressional Republicans And  and what his focus is and hes been very clear about this is delivering for the American people continuing to give them that little bit of breathing room And once we have that meeting set we certainly will share that  The Press And then when it comes to the lameduck you talk about the bipartisanship idea Hes going to need at least 10 Republicans on a government spending package if an omnibus is going to move forward Has he been given any signals by Senate Republican leadership that there will be 10 Republicans for an overarching full fiscal year deal  Ms JeanPierre So look when it comes to the government funding you know our efforts to secure the needed government funding are in good hands with our OMB Director Shalanda Young She is not new to this As you know she did  we  we  we were able to get this done in a bipartisan fashion just last year and so she knows how to reach across the aisle And so we are confident that we will get this done And you know we have been  our Office of Leg Affairs the office  office at OMB as well has been in  has had multiple calls with congressional members and staffers and also have done briefings about how important it is in reaching an agreement  a fullyear appropriations agreement and the dangers of passing the buck yet again And not only that  I think you all saw just last night the Secretary of Defense Secretary Austin put out a letter he wrote to Congress and he said  he said  he warned that a continuing resolution of any length would result in significant harm to the American people military programs and our national security and our competitiveness We have to remember the programs that were talking about are not partisan programs they are programs thats going to help American families Were talking about education Were talking as I just mentioned as the Secretary said our national security You know were talking about things that really truly matter to the American people education cuttingedge technology All of these things are not  are not partisan issues And so we should be able to get this done in a bipartisan way just like we did last year Go ahead  The Press Thanks Karine You mentioned earlier about how passing an assault weapons ban would be an uphill battle especially given the breakdown in Congress I wonder if there are other things the President is considering whether its executive authority or calling on state governors to take action at the state level What are some of the other things that are  that the President is considering  Ms JeanPierre Well so let me just first state  I get your question but let me just first state a couple of things Number one this President has taken more executive action in his first  first year and a half on dealing with gun violence than any other President And that shows his commitment in what he has been able to do and wanting to make sure to protect our communities And so I just want to be very clear on that And lets not forget just a couple of months ago there was a bipartisan legislation on protecting our communities to really deal with the effects of gun violence And so that is something that happened That was the first time we were able to see that type of legislation in 30 years So again I have said this The President is an optimist but he also understands that it is  he sees it as his responsibility to continue to make the case I dont have anything else to preview as to any additional executive action that will be taken from here But again we have seen action on this during his presidency that we hadnt seen in 30 years  The Press I got another question about tomorrow The President is going to Michigan Do you have a preview on what he plans to say and sort of what that portends for his future travel during the lame duck and into the new Congress  Ms JeanPierre Yeah I actually do I have something to share for you all to preview So as you just mentioned the President is going to be going to Michigan specifically Bay City Michigan to discuss the American manufacturing boom Thanks to his economic strategy the President will visit a ma  a new manufacturing facility recently opened by SK siltron which last year announced a 300 million expansion of its Michigan operations During his remarks President Biden will highlight his economic plan is leading to a manufacturing boom growing the economy and creating goodpaying jobs in Michigan and also just across the country as well As you all know the economy has created more than 700000 manufacturing jobs And that is 10 million total jobs created under this President in his first almost two years here in  in the White House He will also discuss Democrats success in the midterm elections in Michigan thanks to our efforts to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out to protect democracy as youve heard the President speak to and to protect womens reproductive healthcare which is something that the President and the Vice President is committed to doing I would expect more coming from us this evening We usually do a background call or have some information out there for you all to just lay out exactly what you can expect from  from the trip Go ahead  The Press On the rail issue again you know when this was  the tentative agreement was announced a few months back it sort of let  it was after  what  an hourslong overnight meeting with all of the parties involved with the Labor Secretary Have the talks reached that level of intensity that level of engagement with the administration And if not is that a strategy we would see employed again essentially putting all of the parties in a room overnight however long it takes and nobody leaves us until theres a deal  Ms JeanPierre No totally appreciate the question Look the President has been very clear A shutdown will be unacceptable As I mentioned Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the unions  the rail unions Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the rail companies And  and Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with the agricultural sector So we have been in regular touch with folks and were continuing to do that The President has had multiple conversations has been directly involved with his administration and also members of Congress And so what we believe and what we will continue to say is that we think  and what should be happening in good faith  is that they should come up with a solution And majority of the unions have ratified this You have 8 out of the 12 which is important to also note But again this is  Im just not going to get into any details on what else we can  other efforts that we might be taking  The Press So theres no meeting like thats been planned or set with every  every representative  Ms JeanPierre I dont have  I dont have anything to preview about convening everyone here all at once But it matters It matters that Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the rail workers It matters that Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the companies And it matters for certain that Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with Ag  the agricultural sector And thats going to continue Those conversations will continue to happen Again the President has been very clear A shutdown is unacceptable It will hurt families communities across the country It will hurt jobs it will hurt farms it will hurt businesses and it should not be happening Go ahead  The Press One question The US Embassy to the Dominican Republic issued a warning to US citizens about those traveling to DR that those that are dark skinned were being targeted This as Dominican Republic is dealing with more deportations of Haitians And so my question is Is there anything that  any response or actions from the administration in light of this warning thats come out  Ms JeanPierre So when it comes to the warnings that comes from the Secretary of State so I would refer you to them on the specifics and the particulars of that  of that warning and would just let them speak to it themselves Go ahead  The Press I just wanted to ask a quick followup The President has said repeatedly that of course he wants to ban assault weapons But on Thanksgiving when he was in Nantucket he said quote The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick Obviously thats a huge category of guns from rifles to pistols to shotguns that are not assault weapons So I guess my question here is Did the President misspeak or does he in fact want to ban all semiautomatic guns  Ms JeanPierre No he was  he was talking about assault weapons Thats what he was talking about on that  on that morning or that afternoon when he was asked that question  The Press Thank you  Ms JeanPierre Okay Great Go ahead  The Press As you know former President Donald Trump had a dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes a known white nationalist Does  is the White House concerned that former President and more importantly a current candidate for President is meeting with someone who is known to foster racist and antisemitic views  Ms JeanPierre So look Im not going to respond to everything that happens with the former President But this  this is something thats important that we speak very clear about and we speak very  very forcefully about This administration this President totally rejects bigotry racism antisemitism And there is just no place for these types of vile forces in our society And this is something that we are going to continue to deny including Holocaust deniers And lets not forget when you say things like this when you  when you do not speak out against these type of poisonous and dangerous kind of remarks or representation if you will that is  that is also incredibly dangerous within itself And so we need to  we should all be condemning this and we should be very clear  very clear and say it in really absolute clear terms And again this is something that we condemn and we will continue to speak out against  The Press A quick one on the World Cup So just while we were sitting here a man with a  carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a Tshirt saying Free  oh no rather Respect for Iranian Women  ran across the pitch and you know was then taken away So first of all is the President going to be  I know hes traveling tomorrow and hes got to give a speech and so on but its right around the time of the big game Is he going to be  is he going to be basically kept abreast of you know how thats going And just on the political side what does he feel about the rights of people to do things like what this man did just now  wave a  wave an LGBT flag and call out for Iranian women  Ms JeanPierre So just more broadly and you know well  well say this Look we  we urge the State of Qatar and all Qataris to fully realize the Amirs message here And that  that is to truly recognize and welcome everyone to the cup  to the World Cup And weve been very clear about that Weve said that many times before We are concerned of  over the potential treatment of LGBTQ spectators and athletes And  and you know this is something that the President will call out any type of human rights abuses He is  he is not shy and has been very clear raising these issues And hell continue to do that And look when it comes to the game tomorrow clearly the President will be kept  kept abreast of how that particular game is going But as you know we will be going  well be traveling to Michigan tomorrow  The Press Thank you Karine  Ms JeanPierre All right Thanks everybody\\r\\n\"\n    ]\n}",
